It is possible to construct malicious pickle data which will execute arbitrary code during unpickling (See https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/blob/main/SECURITY.md#untrusted-models for more details). In a future release, the default value for `weights_only` will be flipped to `True`. This limits the functions that could be executed during unpickling. Arbitrary objects will no longer be allowed to be loaded via this mode unless they are explicitly allowlisted by the user via `torch.serialization.add_safe_globals`. We recommend you start setting `weights_only=True` for any use case where you don't have full control of the loaded file.

    "   - Mutual Learning Phase: Models exchange knowledge via soft predictions while continuing to learn\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Knowledge Exchange Mechanism:\n",
    "   - Each model learns from both hard labels (ground truth) and soft predictions from peers\n",
    "   - KL divergence measures the alignment between a model's predictions and its peers'\n",
    "   - Peer predictions are detached from the computation graph to prevent gradient propagation back\n",
    "   \n",
    "3. Calibration Awareness:\n",
    "   - Beyond accuracy, models are trained to provide well-calibrated uncertainty estimates\n",
    "   - Calibration loss penalizes overconfidence or underconfidence in predictions\n",
    "   - Temperature scaling helps control the sharpness of probability distributions\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Curriculum Learning:\n",
    "   - Mutual learning and calibration weights gradually increase during training\n",
    "   - This allows models to first learn basic patterns before focusing on knowledge exchange\n",
    "   - Learnable temperature parameters adapt to each model's optimal confidence level\n",
    "   \n",
    "5. Feature Alignment (Optional):\n",
    "   - Beyond output-level knowledge exchange, intermediate feature representations can be aligned\n",
    "   - Feature alignment can help transfer richer representational knowledge between architectures\n",
    "   \n",
    "6. Dynamic Overall Loss:\n",
    "   Loss = (1-α) * CE_Loss + α * Mutual_KL_Loss + λ_cal * Calibration_Loss + λ_feat * Feature_Loss\n",
    "   - CE_Loss: Standard cross-entropy with ground truth labels\n",
    "   - Mutual_KL_Loss: Average KL divergence with peer models' predictions\n",
    "   - Calibration_Loss: Penalizes miscalibration of confidence\n",
    "   - Feature_Loss: Optional component aligning intermediate feature representations\n",
